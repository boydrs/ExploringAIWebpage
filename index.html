            Photography began in the early 19th century with the invention of the camera obscura and the development of light-sensitive materials. The first photograph is widely credited to Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826. His method, known as heliography, used a bitumen-coated surface that hardened when exposed to light. While this was a significant breakthrough, the process required extremely long exposure times and produced low-quality images.

            Over the next few decades, inventors like Louis Daguerre and William Henry Fox Talbot improved upon Niépce's work. Daguerre's invention, the daguerreotype, became the first commercially viable photographic process in 1839. Talbot introduced the calotype, which allowed for multiple copies of an image to be made from a single negative. These innovations laid the foundation for the rapid evolution of photography as a practical art form.

        <h2>Modern Photography</h2>
        <p>
            In the 20th century, photography evolved from a specialized practice into a widespread and accessible form of expression. The introduction of 35mm film in the 1920s by companies like Kodak made photography more portable and affordable. Cameras became smaller, lighter, and easier to use, allowing more people to capture moments from their everyday lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            The transition to digital photography in the late 20th century revolutionized the field. Digital cameras eliminated the need for film and darkroom development, allowing photographers to see results instantly. The rise of smartphones with built-in cameras in the 21st century further democratized photography, making it possible for anyone with a phone to take high-quality images. Photography continues to evolve with advances in artificial intelligence and image processing technologies.
